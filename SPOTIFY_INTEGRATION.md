## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created
1. **`/lib/widgets/spotify_preview_card.dart`** - New Spotify preview card widget
2. **`/lib/screens/category_detail_screen.dart`** - Added Spotify section integration
3. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Added `http` and `url_launcher` dependencies

### Technical Components

#### SpotifyPreviewCard Widget
```dart
- Fetches metadata from Spotify oEmbed API
- Displays song thumbnail, title, and artist
- Provides "Play on Spotify" button
- Handles loading states and errors
- Comic book styling with Fredoka fonts
```

#### _SpotifySection Widget
```dart
- Conditional rendering (only for singing categories)
- Horizontal scrollable carousel
- Comic book themed header and description
- Sample song URLs (easily customizable)
```

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://open.spotify.com/oembed?url={spotify_url}`
- **Method**: GET request using `http` package
- **Response**: JSON with title, author_name, thumbnail_url
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback with error indicators

## Configuration

### Adding New Songs
To add or modify the featured songs, update the `spotifyUrls` list in `_SpotifySection`:

```dart
final spotifyUrls = [
  'https://open.spotify.com/track/4iV5W9uYEdYUVa79Axb7Rh', // Rick Astley
  'https://open.spotify.com/track/7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3', // Ed Sheeran
  // Add more Spotify track URLs here
];
```

### Customizing for Other Categories
The Spotify section currently shows only for categories containing "singing" in the name. To modify this:

```dart
// In category_detail_screen.dart
if (widget.data.categoryName.toLowerCase().contains('singing'))
  SliverToBoxAdapter(child: _SpotifySection()),
```

Change the condition to match other categories or make it configurable.

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^1.1.2        # For API requests to Spotify
  url_launcher: ^6.2.2 # For opening Spotify links
```

## How It Works
1. **Category Detection**: Checks if category name contains "singing"
2. **Section Rendering**: Adds Spotify carousel section before registration
3. **Card Loading**: Each card fetches metadata from Spotify oEmbed API
4. **User Interaction**: Play buttons open songs in Spotify app/web player
5. **Error Handling**: Shows error indicators if API requests fail

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can preview and discover music
- **Inspiration**: Featured songs provide inspiration for participants
- **Professional Integration**: Seamless Spotify integration
- **Visual Appeal**: Matches comic book theme perfectly
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient API usage

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic Song Lists**: Fetch songs from backend/CMS
- **Category-specific Playlists**: Different songs for different categories  
- **User Preferences**: Allow users to like/save songs
- **Playlist Creation**: Generate Spotify playlists from featured songs
- **Search Integration**: Allow users to search for songs within the app

## Testing
The integration has been tested with:
- Various Spotify track URLs
- Mobile and desktop responsive layouts  
- API error scenarios
- Loading state behaviors
- Comic book styling consistency

The feature is now ready for production use! ðŸŽµâœ¨
